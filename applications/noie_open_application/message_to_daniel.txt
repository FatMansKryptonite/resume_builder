Hiya Daniel, we met after your talk at Applied AI Nordics (and then again at Meyers Bageri). I am currently looking to switch up my job in favor of something with longer running projects than in my current consultancy role, and NÃ˜IE came to mind. Unfortunately, I cannot find a career page on your website, and the link in your bio is dead. So I was wondering if you could maybe point me in the right direction? If it's of any interest I have attached my CV below. Thanks!
