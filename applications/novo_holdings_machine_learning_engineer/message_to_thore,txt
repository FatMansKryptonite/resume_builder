Hello Thore,

My name is Ivar and I received your contact from one of your team members, Gaia. She mentioned that you are looking for an ML Engineer and thought I should apply. Having read the job advert, I completely agree! She has only good things to say about working at Novo Holdings and I am more than excited to learn more. I have attached a CV and Cover Letter along with this email as well as applied through the official channel.

If you have time for a quick chat this week to get acquainted that would be highly appreciated, I suggest Tuesday before 11, or any time Thursday.

/Kind Regards, Ivar Cashin Eriksson
