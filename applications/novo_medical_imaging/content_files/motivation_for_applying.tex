\section{Motivation for Applying to Data Scientist - Medical Imaging}
Hello, as a Senior Data Scientist enthusiastic about machine learning and with industry experience in medical imaging, I am exited to apply for the position as Data Scientist in the Imaging Analytics department.
I have a strong background in computer vision for the medical industry and good theoretical understanding of the underlying theory that lays the foundation for all machine learning algorithms.
I excel at breaking down complex problems into digestible mathematical statements, and making technically complex solutions accessible to stakeholders and colleagues with different backgrounds.
From all the good things I have heard, such as the focus on quality and the highly engaging and impactful work, I believe \company{} could be the perfect fit, and I therefore wish to apply for the role as \role{}.
\newpar My previous experience in the life-science sector comes from my time as data scientist at RaySearch Laboratories.
There, I appreciated having a lasting impact on patient well-being, and data science for life-science is something I would very much like to return to.
Hence, I am motivated to transition from my current role as Senior Data Science Consultant at Valcon back into a position with long-term engagements, improving patient-outcomes.
My blend of industry and academic experience, and technical expertise would make me a great fit for this role.
