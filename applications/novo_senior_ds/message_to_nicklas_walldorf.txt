Hi Nicklas, I have seen your job listing regarding the role as a Senior Data Scientist. I know Novo Nordisk gets loads of applicants and therefore often doesn't want a cover letter included with the application. Rather, I have seen Novo Nordisk sometimes prefers a short "Motivation for Applying" included with the CV. Seeing as this is your listing, do you have any preference? Sorry for bothering you on a Sunday, and thanks!
