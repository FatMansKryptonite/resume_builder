Hello, I am a Senior Data Scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics. I excel at breaking down complex business problems into digestible statements, and making technically complex solutions accessible to stakeholders and colleagues with different backgrounds. From all the good things I have heard, I believe Google Cloud could be the perfect fit, and I therefore wish to apply for the role as a Field Solutions Architect (Generative AI).

I have spent a lot of my time mentoring junior colleagues and ensured the small data science team at Valcon has been developing in the right direction. This is something I have come to greatly enjoy, and I value growing together with my colleagues. I am currently working on a machine learning model to enhance the quality of our client's invoicing process. I have architected and built a solution that is currently running in their production systems. The project covers topics such as deep learning, NLP, fine-tuning pre-trained models, advanced custom training loops, and deployment of a real-time endpoint. We are currently working on expanding the MLOps and CI/CD framework to be able to train and deploy new versions with minimal overhead.

In my spare time I enjoy working with my hands as well as programming. I have designed and built such things as lamps and other furniture. Currently, I am working on a project to automatically update a custom photo frame with art created by the GPT and DALL-E APIs, inspired by recent events. The photo frame will be running on a Raspberry Pi inside a handmade Ash frame.

I believe that my blend of industry experience, and technical expertise will serve me well in supporting customers to adopt cutting edge technologies that works for their businesses. Furthermore, my curiosity and creativity will drive me to adopt, understand and improve all the latest what Google can offer in the field of AI.
