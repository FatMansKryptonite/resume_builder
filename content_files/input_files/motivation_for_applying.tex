\section{Motivation for Applying}
Hello, I wish to apply for the role as a \role{}. I am motivated to transition from my current role as Senior Data Science Consultant at Valcon back into a position with more long-term engagements, and I believe \company{} could be the perfect fit. \newpar My experience as a Data Science Researcher at RaySearch Laboratories provided me with in-depth knowledge of data science in the medical industry. Lately, I have worked as a Senior Data Scientist in a consultancy role where I have applied my skills to a variety of problem domains. Alongside this, I have spent a lot of my time mentoring junior colleagues and ensured the small data science team at Valcon has been developing in the right direction. My blend of industry experience, technical expertise, and leadership skills would make me a great fit for this role.
