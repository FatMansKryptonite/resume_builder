\section{Motivation for Applying}
Hello, I wish to send an unsolicited application for work as a \role{}. I am motivated to transition from my current role as Senior Data Science Consultant at Valcon back into a more research-intensive environment, and I believe \company{} could be the perfect fit. I have previously worked in the medical industry as a Data Science Researcher at RaySearch Laboratories. In this role, I attained an in-depth grasp of radiotherapy for cancer treatment and innovatively applied machine learning to the domain. The meaningful impact on patient well-being this role provided, and the attention to detail it required deeply motivated me. Lately, I have worked as a Senior Data Scientist in a consultancy role where I have applied my skills to a variety of problem domains. I have also spent a lot of time mentoring my junior colleagues and ensured the team has been developing in the right direction. This is why I choose to apply.
