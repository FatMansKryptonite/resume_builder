    "long": "Developed deep learning, computer vision algorithms for biomedical applications, specifically for feature extraction from CT images used by oncologists for cancer treatment planning. Features were later used for automatic treatment planning of cancer patients. The methods used in the project include, but are not limited to, deep and convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, optimisation, and massively scalable and sparse Gaussian processes.",
    "short": "Developed deep learning algorithms for biomedical applications. Close collaboration with medical professionals was essential to ensure the clinical relevance of projects.",
    "in_depth": "Developed novel computer vision algorithms for biomedical applications, specifically for feature extraction from CT images used by oncologists for cancer treatment planning. The project focused heavily on being able to segment patient anatomy and, from that, to create a feature representation of the segmentation. With the feature vector, a distance metric could be learned to create a similarity measure between patients. Finally, with a similarity, patient treatment plans can be designed automatically using information about how similar patients have been treated in the past. The methods used in the project include, but are not limited to, deep and convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, optimisation, and massively scalable and sparse Gaussian processes.",
    "lexicographic": "Additionally, developed the lexicographic treatment planning algorithms in RaySearch products. This involved completely redesigning the algorithms and optimisation problems to better suit the task. Here, close collaboration with medical professionals was essential to ensure the clinical relevance of the project."
