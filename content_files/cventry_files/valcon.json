    "introduction": "Functioning as the lead data scientist on a variety of projects in industries such as pharmaceuticals, pension, energy transmission, IoT systems, disaster recovery, construction, and manufacturing. A large part of my role at Valcon consists of mentoring more junior colleagues. This, among other things, involves showing how to properly architect data science solutions to make for a maintainable and robust solution, as well as teaching data science practices. I have initiated and given internal trainings in explainability for machine learning and Git, and have had a central coordinating role in the data science team.",
    "business_angle": "At Valcon, all projects incorporate a business perspective. I have presented the results of complex data science projects to a diverse audience, ranging from junior staff to C-level executives. This has garnered much positive feedback, and I find that maintaining a lighthearted approach helps engage and inspire the audience.",
    "manufacturing": "One recent project involved extracting and analysing a large IoT dataset. The data came from an ice cream manufacturing line where we wished to explain the variability in operator productivity. This was done with the use of clustering of operators to gain an understanding of the differences in modes of operation. In addition, we developed a set of dashboards hosted together with the data platform in a docker container for easy portability.

    "advanced_ds":  "My current project involves training a real-time deep neural network with an advanced custom training pipeline and modular architecture. The training data consists of natural-language and high dimensional multi-class labels which makes for a challenging prediction problem. I am the lead data scientist and architect of the solution and responsible for implementing the end-to-end production ready pipeline. I lead a small dynamic team of data engineers and data scientists.",
    "rag":  "Actively developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system together with my colleagues, as a product offering from Valcon. The work involves experimentation with available LLM APIs to learn how to achieve the best results for our clients. The system is built in a highly modular manner, to enable quick switching between LLMs serviced via external APIs or self hosting, different cloud platforms, and different document corpora, all depending on client needs.",
    "mentoring":  "I have for a long time been mentoring my colleagues in data science practices and how to go from business problem to machine learning solution. I am currently the designated mentor/development lead for 2 of colleagues.",
    "peoples_choice": "In 2023 I was awarded the Valcon People's Choice award for exemplary work, leadership, team spirit and scientific curiosity."
