% \section{Motivation for Applying}
% Hello, I wish to send an unsolicited application for work as a Senior Data Scientist. I am motivated to transition from my current role as Senior Data Science Consultant at Valcon back into a more research-intensive environment, and I believe Minerva Imaging could be the perfect fit. I have previously worked in the medical industry as a Data Science Researcher at RaySearch Laboratories. In this role, I attained an in-depth grasp of radiotherapy for cancer treatment and innovatively applied machine learning to the domain. The meaningful impact on patient well-being this role provided, and the attention to detail it required deeply motivated me. This is why I choose to apply. I hope to hear back from you soon.

% \section{Motivation for Applying}

% Hello, I wish to send an open application for work as an \textit{Experienced Data Scientist}. I am motivated to transition from my current role as Senior Data Science Consultant at Valcon back into a more research-intensive environment, and I believe \[COMPANY\] could be a great fit. 

% \hspace{8 mm}I have previously worked in the medical industry as a Data Science Researcher at RaySearch Laboratories. In this role, I attained an in-depth grasp of radiotherapy for cancer treatment and innovatively applied machine learning to the domain. The meaningful impact on patient well-being this role provided, and the attention to detail it required deeply motivated me. Lately, I have worked as a Senior Data Scientist in a consultancy role where I have applied my skills to a variety of problem domains. I have also spent a lot of time mentoring my junior colleagues and ensured the team has been developing in the right direction.
