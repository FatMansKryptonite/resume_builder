\section{Introduction}
To whom it may concern, I wish to send an unsolicited application for work as a Senior Data Scientist. I am motivated to transition from my current role as Senior Data Science Consultant at Valcon back into a more research-intensive environment, and I believe \company{} could be the perfect fit. I have previously worked in the medical industry as a Data Science Researcher at RaySearch Laboratories. In this role, I attained an in-depth grasp of radiotherapy for cancer treatment and innovatively applied machine learning to the domain. The meaningful impact on patient well-being this role provided, and the attention to detail it required deeply motivated me. This is why I choose to apply.


\hspace{7 mm} I would be a good fit for \company{} as I have experience with machine learning, various programming languages, physics, statistics, and other engineering disciplines. This includes autoencoders for feature extraction from CT scans, Python (TensorFlow, pandas, SciPy, etc.), C\#, R, radiotherapy, massively scalable Gaussian processes, deep neural networks, optimisation, hidden Markov models, various financial instruments and more.

\section{Work Experience}
I am currently working at Valcon as a Senior Data Scientist Consultant. My daily work involves a wide variety of data science tasks and finding insights in any sort of data from any sector. Examples of previous work include clustering of IoT and churn analysis. Being a consultant means that the projects always have a business angle and that being able to present the results in an understandable manner is as important as the results themselves.

In addition to my work on projects, I have played a large role in developing the data team at Valcon. As part of my work, I have been deeply involved in the hiring process for our data team to ensure we have the right mix of people in the team. I have also made sure to up-skill my colleagues by constructing trainings in machine learning explainability and Git.

I am currently working at Valtech as a Data Scientist Consultant. My daily work involves a wide variety of data science tasks and finding insights in any sort of data from any sector. Examples of previous work include clustering of web analytics data and time series forecasting. Being a consultant means that the projects always have a business angle and that being able to present the results in an understandable manner is as important as the results themselves.

\hspace{7 mm} As a consultant, I am exposed to a range of different problems within data science, and it is important to quickly understand the task at hand. I design tests, models, and solutions to solve the problems posed. This means having a wide knowledge base within data science and a great imagination.

\hspace{7 mm} Previously, I worked at RaySearch Laboratories as a Data Scientist and Researcher. This involved improving the lexicographic treatment planning algorithms in RaySearch products. This meant redesigning optimisation problems to be better adapted for the task of radiotherapy planning. This and other projects of mine have been performed in close collaboration with customers and service teams at RaySearch.

\hspace{7 mm} For my master's thesis, I helped RaySearch Laboratories develop a more efficient workflow for finding optimal cancer treatment plans. The work involved developing an innovative automatic treatment pipeline by training a neural network to recognise features of CT images. These features could then be used to find a distance metric between patients in order to more efficiently treat new patients. It also required finding a dose probability density function by means of massively scalable Gaussian processes. My thesis can be found \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JjBF6XcXok5LDPZ22D-DIVR6z7qP2Ux0}{here}}.

% \hspace{7 mm} I also worked as a programmer at FindOut Technologies AB. Here I was in charge of maintaining the company website and wikis.

% \hspace{7 mm} Prior to this, I worked as a trading supervisor at a small Swedish trading firm, Ampfield Aktiebolag. At Ampfield, we used advanced mathematical modeling to minimise our risk to return ratio. The supervisor is endowed with a large amount of responsibility as any incorrect decisions may have the potential to cause a lot of harm.

% \hspace{7 mm} At Ampfield I learned to properly debug my code and to identify possibly problematic situations. As Ampfield utilises advanced mathematics to predict the market, the code I wrote was centered around accuracy and efficiency. Developing this kind of back end code was a great experience and made me further develop my analytical problem solving skills learned at university.

\hspace{7 mm} My previous experience within data science, machine learning, mathematics, and business oriented decision making means that I would quickly become a productive member of the team at \company{}. My data science, and economics background would also help me to faster get a good grasp of \company{}'s products.

\section{Personal}
In my free time, I enjoy time spent on various projects to increase my skill set. These involve everything from coding and 3D printing to woodworking and climbing.
