  \section{Work Experience}
  \cventry{2022--}{Valcon}{Senior Data Science Consultant}{}{}{Functioning as the main data scientist on a variety of projects in industries such as pharmaceuticals, pension, energy transmission, IoT systems, and manufacturing. A large part of my role at Valcon consists of training junior colleagues. This, among other things, involves showing how to properly architect coding solutions to make for a readable, maintainable and robust solution as well as teaching data science practices. I have initiated and given internal trainings in explainability for machine learning and Git and have had a central coordinating role in the data science team. \newpar Projects at Valcon always include a business angle, and presenting findings of advanced research projects to non-technical clients has helped me develop presentation skills for which I have received much positive feedback. One recent project involved extracting and analysing a large IoT data set. The data came from an ice cream manufacturing line where we wished to explain the variability in operator productivity. This was done with the use of clustering of operators to gain an understanding of the differences in modes of operation. \newpar I was recently awarded the Valcon People's Choice award for exemplary work, team spirit and scientific curiosity.}
  \cventry{2021--2022}{Valtech}{Data Science Consultant}{}{}{Worked on many data science projects utilising supervised and un-supervised machine learning methods. Projects undertaken included time series forecasting of order and revenue numbers with Facebook Prophet, clustering survey and website visitor data for website personalisation.}
  \cventry{2019--2021}{RaySearch Laboratories}{Data Science Researcher}{}{}{Developed deep learning algorithms for biomedical applications, specifically for feature extraction from CT images used by oncologists for cancer treatment planning. Features were later used for automatic treatment planning of cancer patients. The methods used in the project include, but are not limited to, Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoders, Optimisation, and Massively Scalable and Sparse Gaussian Processes. Additionally, developed the lexicographic treatment planning algorithms in RaySearch products. This involved completely redesigning the algorithms and optimisation problems to better suit the task. Here, close collaboration with medical professionals was of utmost importance to ensure the clinical relevance of the project.}
